# evive_tech_test_1
This is the Evive Engineering Test provided to me on 7/29/2022. I asked for two extra days due to a number of responsibilities cropping up on the weekend and eating into development time.

This project was developed on a Linux(Xubuntu) Virtual Machine. This project was written in the VSCode IDE in Java 17.0.3 via the support of
the Java Extension pack. This allowed me to use Maven and JUnit4/5 as my build framework and testing tools, respectively. The dependencies should already be outlined in the included pom.xml, but if that does not work, it might be worth a try to replicate the linux + VSCode, Maven, JUnit5 setup and see if it works from there.

How this is possible is the subject of much discussion among scholars, particularly why someone would choose to develop java, on VSCode, in a linux environment, rather than use all the wonderful tools built for Windows, like Eclipse and IntelliJ. The world may never know.

I'd like the record to show that despite the toolchain issues that make me want to scream, this was easily one of the most fun projects I've worked on in a long time. It's a good reminder of how fun programming can be. The hiring manager at Evive should be very proud.
